The existence of null has been the oldest and the most notorious source of runtime
errors. Null has plagued our code with a never ending chain of null checks. It is
time we eliminate null by using techniques that have been shown in languages like
`Rust` and `Haskell`.

Here are some programming languages that don't have null

- Rust
- Haskell
- OCaml
- Standard ML
- Swift

In the JavaScript/TypeScript world things are particularly worse because we have two separate
types of null,`null` and `undefined`.

```javascript
null == undefined; // true
null === undefined; // false
```

```javascript
typeof null; // => "object"
typeof undefined; // => "undefined"
```

This article goes deep into this topic.

In this article I will show you how to eliminate null from your code by using a simple
implementation of the option type from rust in typescript.

I have been learning rust for a couple of months now and I wanted to introduce one of the great
features of rust to TypeScript and JavaScript. So I created the **optionem** library.

# A simple introduction to Option

The option type is used in places were some operation will return either a value or no value.
Null is often used to represent the no value case independent of the type of the value to be
returned. We have seen that this leads to unexpected problems if the programmer calling that
operation forgets to handle the no value case.

For example let's look at a `Map`.

```typescript
interface Map<K, V> {
  // ..
  get(key: K): V | undefined;
  // ..
}
```

The Map interface has a method called get. The functionality of get is returning a **value** stored
inside the map using the key associated with the value otherwise if there is no value stored in the
map with the given key it returns **undefined**.

Now lets see what happens when we call get in our code.

```typescript
const map = new Map();
const value = map.get("key");

console.log(value.length); // ERROR
```

This returns an error because we forgot to check for undefined. This is a dumb example because if you
use typescript you wouldn't make this error. But it shows how forgetting null checks causes runtime
errors.

```typescript
const map = new Map();

map.set("key1", "");
map.set("key2", "value");

if (map.get("key1")) {
  // doesn't execute
  console.log("value exists at key1");
}

if (map.get("key2")) {
  // executes
  console.log("value exists at key2");
}

if (map.get("key3")) {
  // doesn't execute
  console.log("SHOULD NOT RUN: no value at key3");
}
```

This code produces the following output

```text
value exists at key2
```

If we look at the third if-condition we can see that we didn't have a value with the key key3 so the
get method returned an undefined and due to undefined being a `falsey` value in javascript
the if-condition didn't get executed .

Now lets look at the first if-condition. the value at the key key1 is an empty string and empty string
is a `falsey` value, so even though the get method returned a value the value returned was also
`falsey` thus the if condition didn't get executed.

```typescript withLineNumbers=true
if ("") {
  console.log("SHOULD NOT RUN");
} else {
  console.log("empty string is falsey");
}
```

To fix the bug in the first if-condition we need to explicitly check for an undefined.

```typescript title=map.ts
const map = new Map();

map.set("key1", "");
map.set("key2", "value");

if (map.get("key1") !== undefined) {
  console.log("value exists at key1");
}

// ...
```

As we can see in the above example we had to jump through a lot of hoops to get the functionality we
wanted. Now let see how much the Option type would be useful in our example. We will use the option
type from the optionem library.

An implementation of Map that returns an option.

```typescript
import { Option } from "optionem";
interface OptionMap<K, V> {
  // ...
  get(key: K): Option<V>;
  // ...
}
```

First Let's see what option is.

### What is the Option type

The option type represents an optional value. An option is either a `Some` that contains a value or a
`None` that does not. The option type is used in places where in normal circumstances you get returned
a _null_ or _undefined_ if the operation failed.

Think of them this way. The option type has two variants the none and some variants.

```typescript
interface Option<T> {
  // ...
}

class Some<T> implements Option<T> {
  // ...
}

class None<T> implements Option<T> {
  // ...
}
```

Example of using options

```typescript
import { Option } from "optionem";

const some: Option<number> = new Some(10);
const none: Option<number> = new None();
```

Now let's return to our map example.

```typescript
class OptionObjMap<K, V> implements OptionMap<K, V> {
  // ...
}

const map = new OptionObjMap<string, number>();

map.set("key1", 10);

map.get("key1").match({
  Some(val) {
    console.log("key1", val);
  },
  None() {
    console.log("key1: None");
  },
});

map.get("key2").match({
  Some(val) {
    console.log("key2", val);
  },
  None() {
    console.log("key2: None");
  },
});
```

The above code produces the following output

```text
key1 10
key2: None
```

The match method on options takes in an object with two functions namely **None** and
**Some**. The functions are called in different ways depending on which variant of
the option the match method was called on:

- If you call it on a Some it calls the Some function with the value contained
  inside the some.
- If you call it on a None it calls the None function.

By using the the match method of the option we can handle both variants of the
returned Option declaratively. We can see that using has made our code more readable.

### Optionem

There is also another type that I have observed to be very useful in rust. It is
the **Result** type. I am planning on implementing the result type in optionem. Another
missing component is being able to pass async functions to methods on the option interface.

Nonetheless it is a really cool simple library use it in your projects, start it on github and
